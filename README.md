## About this Repository

sdosemon's [^1] program code to solve over [] Project Euler math problems.

Every solved problem has a program written in vanilla Python and occasionally numpy. Thought-process and explanations are given in python notebook. [TO DO: connect to script via jupytext and use pytest to check answer]. Some solution programs include a detailed mathematical explanation/proof in the notebook to justify the code's logic.

## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Who are the problems aimed at?
The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.

Currently we have 1350995 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220 locations throughout the world, and collectively using 114 different programming languages to solve the problems.

## Can anyone solve the problem?
The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So the determined participant will slowly but surely work his/her way through every problem.

> "Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."
